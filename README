Taiga (Tumlee's Allegro-Integrated Game Assembler) is an
Allegro-based game engine and framework written by
Thomas "Tumlee" Gann. It is designed to streamline a lot
of the work that usually goes into making games with Allegro 5.

It includes such features as layered drawing, actor-based
game logic, and a system of handling input that makes checking
the exact state of any key or mousebutton extremely simple.

Although it is distributed free of charge, it would be
nice to give me a little credit if you do decide to use
it for one of your projects!
